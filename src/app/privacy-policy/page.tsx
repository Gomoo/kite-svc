      <h5 className="font-bold">SHARING OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We are not in the business of selling your information. There are,
        however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal data
        with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth

        <li>and Third-Party Service Providers</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform
        certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include
        mailing information, maintaining databases, and processing payments.
        When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we
        only provide them with the information that they need to perform their
        specific function.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
        businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
        reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data may be part
        of the transferred assets.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Related Companies: We may also share your personal data with our

        legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii)
        act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of
        the Application, the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against

      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors under the age of
        18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any personal
        data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
        monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy
        Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data
        without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a minor
        under the age of 18 has provided personal data to us through the
        Application or the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
        delete that information from our databases.

      <p className="mb-4">
        We keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary
        for the purposes described in this Policy, while we have a legitimate
        business need to do so in connection with your account, or as required
        by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is
        longer.
